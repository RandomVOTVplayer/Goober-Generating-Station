Key:
P (Primary, First Rod Group, PCR): 16 Control Rods </br>
S (Secondary, Second Rod Group, SCR): 32 Control Rods </br>
T (Tertiary, Third Rod Group, TCR): 12 </br>
A (AZ Rods (yes, very original ik), Emergency Rod Group, ECR): 16 </br>
Q (Quaternary, Fourth Rod Group, QCR): 16 </</br>
Total Control Rods: 92


It has been a struggle, primarily because I want a good rod spacing and pattern for this. For example, I don't want 7 Secondary Control Rods lined up in a single line. Also, I wanted it to at least make some sort of sense.

I am happy with the design I finally chose, after several hand-written designs to figure out what seems best.

Here is a rundown of the control rods:

# AZ RODS
Here, represented by the red `A` group, are the ECRs. These control rods are designed and placed to be able to kill the majority of a nuclear reaction, but not allow the reactor to reach critical mass, if it is the only group withdrawn.

# PRIMARY RODS
These control rods are the first group, after the AZ rods, to be withdrawn. The control rods allow for finer control of lower powers. If power is too high, these rods are to be withdrawn, as they will only inhibit the ability of the SCR group.

# SECONDARY RODS
These rods serve as the primary method of power control. These control rods are considered "fine" control rods, as they allow for precise control of reactor power (theoretically down to the Kilowatt Thermal range (though this will not be simulated, and only for fine control of MWt).

# TERTIARY CONTROL RODS
These control rods are considered "Coarse" control rods due to their ability to allow for more power output, with use of Graphite displacers. These are the ONLY control rods to have these displacers.

# QUATERNARY RODS
These control rods serve little to no purpose, other than similar to what the Primary rods do. These are only neccisary if there are High Xenon conditions during startup. The control rods are classified as COARSE control rods. It is best to leave these withdrawan unless they are needed.
