# Introduction
This document is intended to help explain what different parts of the reactor, documents, and other things that may be unclear.
This document will contain Teriminology, Mechanics, Design ideas, and more!

# Terminology
Below is a list of Terms, Information about the term, and Abbreviation if applicable.
|Term|Info|Abbreviation|
|----|----|------------|
|CR|Control Rod|
|PCR| Primary Control Rod|
|SCR| Secondary Control Rod|
|TCR| Tertiary Control Rod|
|QCR| Quaternary Control Rod|
|ECR| Emergency Control Rod|
|EOP| Emergency Operating Procedures|
|SOP| Standard Operating Procedures|
|SSOP|Standard Startup Operating Procedures|
|MWt| Megawatt Thermal. it's the reactors energy output|
|Void| fancy way to say steam bubbles|

# Reactor-Specifications

Reactor specs:
- BWR
- Recirculation Loops: 2
- Water pumps: 3
- Turbines: 2
- Max Rated Power (in MWt): 4800
- Positive temperature Coefficient
- Positive Void Coefficient

Level zones:
9 meters ( 354 Inches) - RCIC, LPCI, and Pumps 1 and 2 trip

8 meters ( 314 Inches) - High-High water level warning

7 meters ( 275 inches) - High Water Level warning

4 - 6 Meters (157 inches to 236 inches) - Standard Operating Level

3 meters (118 inches) - Low water level warning

2 meters (78 inches) - Reactor Trip and automatic RCIC actuation, Diesel Generator Auto actuation (unless bypassed)

1 meter (39 inches) - MSIV closure and turbine trip

0 meters (FUEL RANGE) - Meltdown begins in 4 minutes

> [!WARNING]
> if water level is in the fuel range for too long, a Meltdown will start. signs of a full meltdown and partial meltdown will begin to appear after 30 seconds to a minute. See the below information about meltdowns.

## signs of a partial meltdown
- Control rods stuck/ fail to respond
- temperature consistently above 1200Â°F
- temperature gauge cannot maintain a stable temperature
- Feedwater Pumps struggle to maintain a reactor level
- the following annunciators all are receiving an ignition signal
    - CONT_RAD_HI (Radiation > 50 mSv/h)
    - PRIM_CIRC_RAD_HI (Radiation > 15 Sv/h)
    - SEC_CIRC_RAD_HI (Radiation > 5 mSv/h) (only triggers in full meltdown. usually)
    - RECIRC_CAVITATION_[pumps 1 or 2]
    - MSIV_ISOL_SINGLE_RX (based on many conditions. only one condition in the list has to be met for the isolation single to be triggered. theblist can be found here[link coming soon])
- Reactor pressure cannot be maintained properly 
- Reactor power cannot be controlled

# Annunciator-Guide
Annunciators are vital parts of any reactor system. These annunciators have special names thabis unique to the annuncistor, and will never be repeated.

Annunciator designations begin with 'P' which is then followed by a pattern of Numbers and or Letters. This name is not just a random selection of Numbers and Letters, the name describes the location, type of panel, and more about the annunciator grid. Check with the below reference guide for more information.

|Identifier (number or letter) | Information |
|----------------------------- | -----------|
| P (**P**-0000Z000| indicates the name is related to a Control Panel|
|first integer pair (P-**00**00Z000)| these two integers display how many indicators are on the panel. |
|Second integer pair (P-00**00**Z000)| These two integers display which Control Panel the Annunciator Panel os located on. See [Panel ID](#Panel-IDs) section for panel ID information |
|The letter (P-0000**Z**000| Based on the type of Annunciator Panel. See [the Types Of Annuncistors](#Types-Of-Annunciators)  section for more information on Panel types. |
|Integer after the Letter (P-0000Z**0**00) | Boolean (true or false, 1 or 0), If the annuncitor panel indicators can be clicked or has a click able button on the panel to acknowledge and or silence the panel  (if applicable)|
|Second to last Integer (P-0000Z0**0**0)| how many columns the Annunciator Panel has|
|Final Number (P-0000Z00**0**)| how many rows the Annunciator Panel has.|

## Types-Of-Annunciators
> [!note]
> this will be expanded on later

## Panel-IDs
There are 3 panel types that may be seen in Control Rooms throughout the facility.

**Type 1 panels** </br>
these panels are short, Low to the ground and have very little instrumentation on them. they typically only hold a handful of controls, usually Emergency shutdowns, and basic information on them.

[place-holder]

**Type 2 Panels** </br>
These kinds of panels have no Primary Annunciators, and are typically only used for Lowlevel control of some subsytems.

**Type 3 Panels**
