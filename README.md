# Goober-Generating-Station
A Roblox project about operating, managing, and maintaining a Nuclear Reactor.

# What kind of reactor is this?
This is a Non-realistic (not creatable in real life) BWR-RBMK hybrid. The reactor specs are listed below:

Reactor specs:
- BWR
- Recirculation Loops: 2
- Water pumps: 3
- Turbines: 2
- Max Rated Power (in MWt): 4800
- Positive temperature Coefficient
- Positive Void Coefficient
- probably a pain to operate: true


Level zones:
9 meters ( 354 Inches) - RCIC, LPCI, and Pumps 1 and 2 trip
8 meters ( 314 Inches) - High-High water level warning
7 meters ( 275 inches) - High Water Level warning

4 - 6 Meters (157 inches to 236 inches) - Standard Operating Level

3 meters (118 inches) - Low water level warning
2 meters (78 inches) - Reactor Trip and automatic RCIC actuation, Diesel Generator Auto actuation (unless bypassed)
1 meter (39 inches) - MSIV closure and turbine trip
0 meters (FUEL RANGE) - Meltdown begins in 2 minutes
