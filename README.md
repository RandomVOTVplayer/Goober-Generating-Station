- Positive temperature Coefficient
- Positive Void Coefficient
- probably a pain to operate: true


Level zones:
9 meters ( 354 Inches) - RCIC, LPCI, and Pumps 1 and 2 trip
8 meters ( 314 Inches) - High-High water level warning

3 meters (118 inches) - Low water level warning
2 meters (78 inches) - Reactor Trip and automatic RCIC actuation, Diesel Generator Auto actuation (unless bypassed)
1 meter (39 inches) - MSIV closure and turbine trip
0 meters (FUEL RANGE) - Meltdown begins in 2 minutes
